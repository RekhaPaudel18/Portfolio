        Hi there!  I'm Rekha Paudel, a dedicated BCA student currently in my 5th
         semester with a focus on UI/UX design and React.js.
         I have a deep passion for creating user-friendly and visually engaging web 
         experiences that solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Through my studies and projects, I’ve developed a solid foundation in 
        designing intuitive interfaces and building dynamic, responsive web applications
         using modern tools and technologies. I thrive on creativity and love turning ideas
          into functional and 
        aesthetically pleasing digital solutions.
        </p>

    <br />
    <p>Feel free to explore my work and get in touch—I’m always excited to collaborate
       and learn!</p>
